# PearInterview

PearInterview is a web application designed to assist developers to groom their technical interview skills using a peer programing approach. The application provides a interactive code editor in which users can work collaboratively to solve an interview question. At the same time, a random question is displayed depending on the selected dificulty. Once the users have finished the interview, both users can rate their peers providing valuable feedback.
